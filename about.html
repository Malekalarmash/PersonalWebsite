       <h2> Web Devolper Story</h2>
         <h3><a href="https://minesweeperonline.com/">Mine Sweeper</a></h3>
          <p>In 1998,I got my first computer, a gift from a family friend for my outstanding grade in elementry school.
           I spent the whole night trying to figure out this machine and by the very next morning, I learned how to operate one of the very famous games, Mine Sweeper. </p>

         <h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/Ultimate_Doom/"> The First Computing Challenge</a></h3>
           <p>The first challenge I ran into was how to install a game from a C.D into the computer. After saving my money bucket, I was finally able to
            buy my first game (Doom (1993)). I was excited to get home and tried it but I had no idea how to install it on my computer. I was desprate to find
            the answer, the game instructions were written in English and I didnt know any English at that time, I didnt have internet access to ask somebody online and my friends didnt have a computer so I was
            out of resourses but I had the curiosty by myside. I was a very curious kid when I grew up, I loved to figure out things by doing them and learn from my mistakes so I spent the whole day trying every
            way to install the game and when I finally did, I was so proud of myself.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">Shaping The Skills</a></h3>
            <p>By the time I learned how to operate my P.C, I probably had broke my computer a lot but the good thing I was able to trouble shoot it over the phone
            with a Computer Engineer who I met through my dad. I was finally able to take my P.C a part and put it back on with no problems, Yaay!!.
            I remember that I was the one who most of the family would call to fix thier computers, install games, download videos from Youtube and convert them to MP3 so they can copy them into a C.D and listen to them later on the C.D player. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsNaR6FRuO0">The Sound Of Dial-Up Internet</a></h3>
            <p>The Dial-Up Internet Acess was invented in 1992 but we didnt have access in Syria up until 2000.
             It was expensive, hard to get and not all the cities were able to provide it so the idea of having internet at home was nearly impossible.
             After a few years, Internet Coffee Shops were available in major cities, like Damascus and for the first time I was able to go online.</p>

          <h3><a href="#">My Internet Journey</a></h3>
            <p>Me and my cousin Majed were very close growing up, he was a very smart, nerd ,and funny kid too. He figured out how create an email on Yahoo and told me that
              I should too. He also told me that I should pick up a name for my email, "it should be unique, represents who you are" so I came up with a name, it
              was Fire Angel. I chose that name becuase Malek means the hell angle in Arabic. After creating an email, I went on MSN (Chat App) and started adding some random people and chat with them in English.
              My English was terrible but with the help of Google Translate, I was able to meet some people online.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35806229">Loosing It All</a></h3>
            <p>When the conflict started in 2011 in Syria. I was a senior high school student and at some point me and my family had to leave our house immediately, leaving everything behind.
              My computer, my books, and my neighborhood. It was so difficult to lose everything at ones. We left to a safer place, my grandmother house, I was happy going there but heartbroken
              for leaving everything behind. </p>

          <h3><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1cFpE0JRpFcHtjJzHdpZ7hfRS6knxX0km32VQ0/">The Success</a></h3>
            <p>In 2016 and after being a refugee for 4 years in Jordan, a year and half of interviews and waiting I was finally accepeted to resalttle in the U.S. I was excitied to travel and
              expreince a new culture, langauge and a new country. It wasnt easy at the beginning but with a lot of hard work I was able to enroll back in college after 6 years of trying to enroll back to college. In 2019, I became a Computer
              Science student at GSU.

            <h3><a href="https://refcode.org/our-story">The Refcode Community</a></h3>
              <p>I met Brenton Strine (The Refcode Founder) at the Refcode lab in 2021 and we stayed connected. Later, I learned that Refcode is not just
               an eductional program its more like a community of people who have the passion of coding, helping ,and be an inspiration for the rest.
              In January of 2022, I was offered Program Manager position at Refcode and I accepted it. I was excited to launch my career in tech and leadership. My position is to help run the
              program with the help of Brenton.</p>

            <h3><a href="#">Software Technician</a></h3>
              <p>One of Refcode goals is to launch a Software Agency that would help the students and graduates learn from
                real projects and I was excited to be choosen for the first project which is building a website for animal shelter and as of this moment, we are still working on it.</p>
