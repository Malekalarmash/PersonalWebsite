    <img src="../img/personal.jpg" alt="portrait">
    <p>My name is Malek Alarmash and I was born and raised in Damascus, Syria 1993.
      I was seven years old when I got my first computer as a gift from my dad's friend as a gift for my
      outstanding grades. I was super exited that night and couldnt go to bed, I discovered the awesome Minesweeper game!
